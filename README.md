# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This Project is written based on a hand game Rock Paper Scissors usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously chooses one option among the three “ROCK  PAPER SCISSORS”.  A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" ), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock") a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied. Based on these rules score will be generated.
